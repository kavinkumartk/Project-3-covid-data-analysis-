🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using multiple datasets. The goal is to analyze trends, compare country-level outcomes, and visualize the progression of cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.

By combining time-series data, day-wise global summaries, and country-level statistics, this project provides insights into the spread, severity, and key metrics of COVID-19.

📂 Datasets Used

1.covid_19_clean_complete.csv – Base dataset with case-level details (by date & country).

2.worldometer_data.csv – Snapshot dataset with country-level stats (cases, deaths, tests, etc.).

3.full_grouped.csv – Cleaned and grouped data by country and date.

4.day_wise.csv – Aggregated global day-level dataset.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas → data cleaning and manipulation

numpy → numerical analysis

matplotlib, seaborn → static visualizations

plotly → (optional) interactive dashboards
